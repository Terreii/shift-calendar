# Shift Calendar

This is a port to Ruby on Rails of [shift-calendar-rt](https://github.com/Terreii/shift-calendar-rt).

But this might not get released! Mostly because my employer did release an employee app. Which
includes a shift-calendar.

## Setup

The newest Ruby version is needed. As defined in [.ruby-version](./.ruby-version).
You also need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed.

This is a standard RoR app. It uses SASS & Bootstrap. So to start development run:

```sh
bin/dev
```

And then open http://127.0.0.1:3000/
